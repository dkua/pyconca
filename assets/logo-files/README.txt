NOTE:
- The "-500x500.svg" and "-500x500.png" version has, as the name suggests, been
  optimized for 500x500px resolution (see: http://dcurt.is/pixel-fitting).
- The -2v2 version has a vectorized maple leaf.
- The "2 inch logo" version has an oversized border to ensure that the sticker
  border will be 100% red.
